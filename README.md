# The *CRISTINA* project

The research project "**C**o**R**ona v**I**rus **S**pa**TI**al a**NA**lysis" (CRISTINA) examines the time series progress of COVID-19 events in 177 countries of the world. We collect daily data for events as well as government interventions and associate them with geographical time-series datasets in order to evaluate the rate of change. We also estimate future events based on assumptions of previous events in a time window of 5 days. Future projections, are based on assumptions and should only be used for educational reasons.
